Note: 
1. “Summary of IRNP RdNet Entities” above is revised to show “Entity in ER Diagram” which matches with the names shown on ER 
Diagram at the end of this data specification. 
2. The following changes of entity have been implemented: 
 “RD_ID_7”, “RD_ID_8”, “RD_ID_9” and “RD_ID_10” are added to the entity “INTERSECTION”. 
 Entity “rndabout” is renamed to “ROUNDABOUT”. 
 Entity “traf_features” is renamed to “TRAFFIC_FEATURES”. 
 A new entity “Prohibition” has been added to IRNP RdNet. 
 The attribute “GOODS_VEHICLE” has been removed from entity “Vehicle Restriction”. 
 Entity “runinout” is renamed to “run_in_out”. 
 Entity “Roadroute” is removed and the Linear Reference events are replaced with line or point features.
